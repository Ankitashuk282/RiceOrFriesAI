# RiceOrFriesAI
ML model to detect if an image contains rice or chips(fries)

A dataset of food images was crowd-sourced from Machine Learning students pursuing a Master's in Data Science, Batch of 2024, at Queen Mary University of London. 
3250 images were chosen that contained either rice or chips. 

The aim of the project was to identify if an image contained rice or chips. A csv file with correct classification of 768 images was provided that was to be used as training and test dataset. (MLEndYummyDataset.csv)

I created a basic model first and then improved it. 

To see the implementation of both the models, please download the file and upload it to Google Collab. The files are already present with outputs.
